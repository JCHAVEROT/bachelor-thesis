%TODO: Acknowledgments

\noindent Before we dive into the real subject, I would like to make a few acknowledgements. First and foremost I must thank my advisors Andrew Price and Chen Zhao for accepting my request to write a Bachelorâ€™s Thesis under their guidance. I am grateful to have been able to practice my skills with them, and can only hope that the feeling is mutual. Moreover I would also like to thoroughly thank my friends and family for supporting me in my academic journey, despite a rather unstable start in my studies.
