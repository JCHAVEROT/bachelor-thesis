To appreciate the quality of the estimations, the most widely used pose error functions are the \ac{ADD} and the \ac{ADD-S} metrics, both introduced by Hinterstoisser et al. \cite{10.1007/978-3-642-37331-2_42}. For an object model $\mathcal{M}$, we compute the average distance to the corresponding model point. Therefore the error of an estimated pose $\hat{\bm{P}}=(\hat{\bm{R}},\,\hat{\bm{T}})$ w.r.t. the ground truth pose $\bar{\bm{P}}=(\bar{\bm{R}},\,\bar{\bm{T}})$ is calculated as follows:

\begin{align}
	e_\mathrm{ADD}(\hat{\bm{P}},\,\bar{\bm{P}},\,\mathcal{M})&=\underset{\bm{x}\in\mathcal{M}}{\mathrm{avg}}\norm\bigg{\bar{\bm{P}}\bm{x}^\star-\hat{\bm{P}}\bm{x}^\star}_2 \,\textit{\footnotemark}\\
	&=\underset{\bm{x}\in\mathcal{M}}{\mathrm{avg}}\norm\bigg{(\bar{\bm{R}}\bm{x}+\bar{\bm{T}})-(\hat{\bm{R}}\bm{x}+\hat{\bm{T}})}_2
\end{align}
\footnotetext{In this context, the vector $\bm{x}^\star$ represents a vector that has been extended by appending a 1, specifically for the purpose of matrix multiplication.}

When the model $\mathcal{M}$ has symmetries that leads to no indistinguishable views, the error is computed as the average distance to the closest model point:
 
\begin{align}
	e_{\mathrm{ADD}\text{-}\mathrm{S}}(\hat{\bm{P}},\,\bar{\bm{P}},\,\mathcal{M})&= \underset{\bm{x}_1\in\mathcal{M}}{\mathrm{avg}}\min\limits_{\bm{x}_2\in\mathcal{M}}\norm\bigg{\bar{\bm{P}}\bm{x}_1^\star-\hat{\bm{P}}\bm{x}_2^\star}_2 \\
	&=\underset{\bm{x}_1\in\mathcal{M}}{\mathrm{avg}}\min\limits_{\bm{x}_2\in\mathcal{M}}\norm\bigg{(\bar{\bm{R}}\bm{x}_1+\bar{\bm{T}})-(\hat{\bm{R}}\bm{x}_2+\hat{\bm{T}})}_2
\end{align}

It's important to point out that $e_{\mathrm{ADD}\text{-}\mathrm{S}}$ is more lenient compared to $e_\mathrm{ADD}$, and should only be applied in cases where there is a definite presence of symmetry in the object and the estimated pose is already notably precise. Otherwise, using $e_{\mathrm{ADD}\text{-}\mathrm{S}}$ becomes irrelevant since the estimation is advantaged.
