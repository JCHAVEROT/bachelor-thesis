\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

In summary, after overcoming several software engineering challenges, we successfully reimplemented Gen6D for the \textsc{Spacecraft} dataset. While the current results are somewhat disappointing, we have identified several promising tracks for future exploration to enhance the pose estimation accuracy.

Knowing that the dataset team has developed new renderings this semester with dozens of new models, there is ample opportunity to further test Gen6D. More importantly, this development opens up the potential for retraining the model.

From a personal standpoint, this project was my first experience working as part of a significant and motivated team, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It taught me to better organize my work, to operate on a remote server like Scitas Izar, to understand the functioning of a deep learning architecture in a practical, applied setting, to write Python scripts, and finally to improve my English skills through Zoom meetings and the writing of this very report.
