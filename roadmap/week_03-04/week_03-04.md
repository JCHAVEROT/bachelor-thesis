# 02.10.2023 to 16.10.2023

## What was done

- Read Gen6D paper, went through its code to understand it better.
- Tried to make the Scitas environment work unsuccessfully: need administrator's permissions to install the dependencies.
- Made the Gen6D code work on my MacOs computer despite not having a Nvidia GPU : installed all librairies, had to make several changes in the code to remove the calls to the CudaToolKit dependency.
- Run sucessfully Gen6D on my computer with their pretrained model.
- Run Gen6D for a custom object: installed COLMAP and CloudCompare, but environment with CUDA required.


## What is to be done

- Understand how Scitas works, so to create a virtual environment with all dependencies.
- Retrain Gen6D.

## Questions to ask

- None for the moment.
