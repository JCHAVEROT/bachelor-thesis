# 25.09.2023 to 02.10.2023

## What was done

- Read multiple scientific papers about recent generalizable 6-DoF object pose estimators so to be able to present them.
- Presented BundleSDF, LocPoseNet, Templates for 3D Object Pose Estimation Revisited: Generalization to New Objects and Robustness to Occlusions, Wide-Depth-Range 6D Object Pose Estimation in Space.
- Had issues with not having enough space storage to download their dataset (over 100GB).


## What is to be done

- Task for week 3 and 4: delve into GEN6D so as to reimplement it with our own data, and maybe to retrain it.

## Questions to ask

- Which ML environment we using ? Scitas, Google Colab, CVLab servers, our PC ?
