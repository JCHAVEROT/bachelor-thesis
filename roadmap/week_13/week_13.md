# 11.11.2023 to 18.12.2023

## What was done

- Inverted the masks manually. with a python script relying on the CV library.

## What is to be done

- Since the issue was not solved by correcting the masks, still have to find it.


## Questions to ask

- Is the object center indeed (0, 0, 0) ?
- The detector seems to be the problem, with a detection square too small for the object, need to investigate that.
