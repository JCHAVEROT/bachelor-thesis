# 27.11.2023 to 04.12.2023

## What was done

- Figured out how the model was loding data when not using COLMAP with the file eval.py (MOSTLY SAME AS LAST WEEKS).
- Modified files eval.py, database.py, spacecraft_object_data_prepare.py.
## What is to be done

- Better understand each dependencies, files format, what happens on load.
- Mimic the LINEMOD data file organization, and adapt the code in consequence.


## Questions to ask

- None for the moment.
